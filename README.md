## Building semi-reliable, "persistent" V3 chromium extensions
A [known "issue"](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1152255) of chromium builds (for about 2 years now) is that V3 extensions are no longer 'awakened' by event listeners, such as alarmListeners, webRequests or runtime messages. The only event i found which can be of use and actually wakes the background script is `tabs.onActivated`, but that requires the user to switch tabs. This, combined with the fact that V3 manifest extensions no longer support setting`persistent:true` in the manifest for the background script, and **chrome web store no longer accepts manifest V2 extensions** means that if we now want an extension to run constantly (listen) in the background for changes we have to settle for one of the available workarounds.

In the case of this extension, it is necessary for the background script to be persistent, listening for updates once every minute, so that the user can be notified for any updates of the livestream status. This is achieved semi-reliably using multiple hacks

### **Hack 1 - connect to an active tab via its port ['keepAlive'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66618136/persistent-service-worker-in-chrome-extension)**

Fix borrowed from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66618136/persistent-service-worker-in-chrome-extension)

When installing, this extension prompts the user that it can **'read and write'  to** **all webpages the user is in**. Though theoretically possible, the extension doesn't do that. It uses the <all_hosts> broad permission so that it may connect to any open tab, because when port connection is established, the service worker shuts down after 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds. Additionally, it auto-disconnects from that tab and reconnects every 4 minutes, so that the timeout time is reset.

**Advantages**: semi-reliable "persistent" extension. All event listeners work properly when the service woker is active

**Disadvantages:** Scary message when installing extension, the need for an open 'http/https' chrome tab.


### Hack 2 - restart the extension after a long period of inactivity

Hack 1 works for the most part, but if the user leaves their computer idling for a long period of time, or it goes into sleep mode, the reconnect functionality is *sometimes* never called and the extension stops working properly. That's why in the `background.js` script, whenever the user switches tabs, we check if time elapsed since `lastUpdated > 5 minutes`. If so, the extension detects that its not updating and reloads itself.⠀⠀⠀

**Advantages**: Ensuring the extension functions even after long periods of inactivity

**Disadvantages**: Extension hidden from extension bar while the reload process is taking place (<50ms). In the rare case that user wakes computer from sleep into an open chrome tab and never opens another, the extension will appear to have the last updated status.⠀⠀⠀⠀


### Hack 3 - restarting the `chrome.alarm` every 30 minutes to prevent batch requests⠀

While writing the extension, i've encountered an issue [similar to this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73229521/chrome-alarms-is-racing-to-catch-up-if-system-time-changed). When the user opens chrome after a period of inactivity, the alarm listener seems to race to catch up to the current system time, by sending multiple events every minute. This results in multiple requests being fired each minute, which is just a waste of resources. In order to fix this, whenever the user switches tabs, we check if `lastAlarmUpdate > 30 minutes`. If so, we restart the alarm to prevent batching requests.

**Advantages**: Extension no longer fires batch `fetch` requests

**Disadvantages**: -

Writing this as a 'lessons learned' in case someone is trying to write a 'persistent' v3 extension. Hope it was helpful <3
